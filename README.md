vim-tabber
=============

A Vim plugin for labeling and manipulating tabs, visually styled after
[Powerline](http://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline), with additional
tab management utilities.

Features
--------

* User-definable tab labels.
* Default labels based on tab numbers.
* Tab numbers and window counts in each tab.
* A command for selecting the last active tab.
* Powerline-inspired styling and glyphs.

Installation
------------

Install via [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/fweep/vim-tabber.git

Add this to your .vimrc:

    set tabline=%!tabber#TabLine()

Setting Labels
--------------

Tab labels default to pathshorten() on the active buffer name.  If the buffer has no name, "\[No Name\]"
is displayed.  You can override the default label for a tab and set your own.  The tab will use your label
until you clear it or close the tab.

To set a label for the current tab:

    :TabberLabel My Tab Name

To remove the label from the current tab:

    :TabberClear

You can also set/remove labels on other tabs by prefixing the command with the tab number:

    :4TabberLabel New Name For Tab Four
    :4TabberClear

New Tabs
--------

To create a new tab with a label:

    :TabberNew Refactoring Controller

You can supply an optional count prefix to TabberNew, to specify where the new tab should be opened.
This behavior is the same as Vim's `:tabnew`.  See `:help tabnew`.

    :TabberNew New Tab After Current Tab
    :0TabberNew New First Tab
    :2TabberNew New Third Tab
    :999TabberNew New Last Tab

Last Active Tab
---------------

To move to the last active tab:

    :TabberSelectLastActive

Predefining Labels
------------------

You can predefine label names that will be used when a matching tab number opens:

    let g:tabber_predefined_labels = { 1: 'Models', 2: 'Views', 3: 'Controllers' }

If Vim opens with one tab, it will be labeled "Models".  When you open a second tab, it will
be named "Controllers".  When you open a fourth tab, it will use the normal naming rules.

If the tabs are re-arranged (e.g. by inserting a tab before a labeled one), the label will
stay with the tab it was originally assigned to.

If a default label is no longer in use&mdash;either because you renamed it, or because the
tab was closed&mdash;the next tab to open in that slot will be assigned the default label.

Default Labels
--------------

You can set a default label for tabs created with `:TabberNew`:

    set g:tabber_default_user_label = 'Scratch'

You can set a default label for new tabs that are created without a label:

    set g:tabber_default_unknown_label = 'Temp'

This will apply to tabs created by `:tabnew`, by other plugins, etc.  It will apply
to labels created by `:TabberNew` if `g:tabber_default_user_label` is not set.

Predefined labels always take precedence over these options.

Other Options
-------------

Prompt for a label if `:TabLineNew` is called with no arguments, and no defaults apply:

    let g:tabber_prompt_for_new_label = 1

Example Bindings
----------------

Bind \<C-t\> to open a new tab at the end of the tab list with the label "Scratch":

    nnoremap <C-t> :999TabberNew Scratch<CR>

Bind \<C-e\> to switch to the last active tab:

    nnoremap <C-e> :TabberSelectLastActive<CR>

Compatibility
-------------

Tested with Vim 7.3.

Limitations
-----------

Tab labels are lost when saving/restoring sessions.  If you have configured default labels,
they will be applied.
