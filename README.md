fweep-tabline
=============

A Vim plugin for labeling and manipulating tabs, visually styled after
[Powerline](http://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline), with additional
tab management utilities.

Features
--------

* Powerline-inspired styling and glyphs.
* User-definable tab labels.
* Tab numbers and window counts in each tab.
* A command for selecting the last active tab.

Installation
------------

Install via [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/fweep/fweep-tabline.git

Add this to your .vimrc:

    set tabline=%!tabline#TabLine()

Labels
------

Tab labels default to pathshorten() on the active buffer name.  If the buffer has no name, "\[No Name\]"
is displayed.  You can override the default label for a tab and set your own.  The tab will use your label
until you clear it or close the tab.

To set a label for the current tab:

    :TabLineLabel My Tab Name

To remove the label from the current tab:

    :TabLineClear

You can also set/remove labels on other tabs by prefixing the command with the tab number:

    :4TabLineLabel New Name For Tab Four
    :4TabLineClear

New Tabs
--------

To create a new tab with a label:

    :TabLineNew Refactoring Controller

You can supply an optional count prefix to TabLineNew, to specify where the new tab should be opened.
This behavior is the same as Vim's `:tabnew`.  See `:help tabnew`.

    :TabLineNew New Tab After Current Tab
    :0TabLineNew New First Tab
    :2TabLineNew New Third Tab
    :999TabLineNew New Last Tab

Last Active Tab
---------------

To move to the last active tab:

    :TabLineSelectLastActive

Example Bindings
----------------

Bind \<C-t\> to open a new tab at the end of the tab list with the label "Scratch":

    nnoremap <C-t> :999TabLineNew Scratch<CR>

Bind \<C-e\> to switch to the last active tab:

    nnoremap <C-e> :TabLineSelectLastActive<CR>

Compatibility
-------------

Tested with Vim 7.3.

Limitations
-----------

Tab labels are lost when saving/restoring sessions.
