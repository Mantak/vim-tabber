Thanks to Kim Silkeb√¶kken for writing the excellent Powerline plugin!  Much of TabLine's
code was copied from or modeled after Powerline.

Features
--------

* Powerline-inspired styling.
* User-definable tab labels.
* Tab numbers and window counts in each tab.

### Pending

* Tab reordering.
* User-definable highlighting.
* Status display options.

Installation
------------

Install via [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/fweep/fweep-tabline.git

Usage
-----

Add this to your .vimrc:

    set tabline=%!fweeptabline#TabLine()

Labels
------

Tab labels default to pathshorten() on the active buffer name.  If the buffer has no name, "\[No Name\]"
is displayed.  You can override the default label for a tab and set your own.  The tab will use your label
until you clear it or close the tab.

If you close a tab or otherwise cause the tabs to be renumbered, your label will still apply to the tab
number you specified when setting it.  If I can figure out how to detect a tab closing event, this behavior
will become configurable.

To set a tab label:

    call fweeptabline#SetTabLabel(tabnumber, "Your Label")

To remove a tab label:

    call fweeptabline#ClearTabLabel(tabnumber)
